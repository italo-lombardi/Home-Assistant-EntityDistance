# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.5] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- **Proximity duration lost on restart** — when HA restarted while a pair was in proximity, the elapsed time from `proximity_since` to the shutdown was silently discarded. Duration is now credited on restore.
- **Cross-midnight today-time gap** — the interval straddling midnight was never credited to either day's `today_proximity_seconds` or `today_zone_seconds`. The pre-midnight slice is now flushed before the daily reset, and the post-midnight slice is accumulated separately.
- **Config entry migration missing** — `async_migrate_entry` (v1 single-pair → v2 group format) was accidentally removed in a cleanup commit. Any user upgrading from 0.1.x got a permanently disabled entry. Migration is restored.
- **Today-time accumulated before reliability check** — `today_proximity_seconds` was incremented based on a proximity state that the reliability filter might then roll back. Duration is now only accumulated after the reliability check finalises the proximity state.
- **`AnyInProximity` / `AllInProximity` returned `False` when all pairs had bad GPS** — sensors now return `None` (unavailable) when every pair has `data_valid = False`, preventing automations from seeing a confident `False` instead of unavailable.
- **`last_seen_together` stamped at wrong moment** — previously set on the EXIT detection tick, meaning it recorded the first moment the pair was *outside* the exit threshold rather than the last moment they were inside it. Now stamped on every in-proximity tick and on the EXIT tick, always reflecting the last confirmed in-proximity observation.
- **`TOTAL_INCREASING` state class on daily-reset sensors** — `TodayProximityTimeSensor` and `TodayZoneTimeSensor` used `TOTAL_INCREASING`, which tells HA long-term statistics to treat midnight resets as counter rollbacks, corrupting historical graphs. Both now use `MEASUREMENT`.
- **`today_zone_seconds` dataclass field used `None` sentinel** — `PairState.today_zone_seconds` was declared as `None` with a `__post_init__` workaround, making `dataclasses.replace()` produce a broken copy. Now uses `field(default_factory=dict)`.
- **`_CARD_INSTALLED_KEY` not cleared on last-entry unload** — the flag preventing duplicate Lovelace resource registration was never cleared when the last config entry was removed, causing stale resources after a full reload. Flag is now cleared when no entries remain.
- **Static path exception swallowed without details** — exception object is now included in the debug log message.
- **`DEFAULT_MAX_SPEED_KMH = 1000`** — a GPS jump of ~278 m/s passed the speed filter. Lowered to 250 km/h (~70 m/s), a realistic upper bound for ground-based tracking.
- **Duplicate window constant** — `UPDATES_FREQUENCY_WINDOW_S` was hardcoded to `1800` separately from `DEFAULT_UPDATES_WINDOW_S`. `UPDATES_FREQUENCY_WINDOW_S` now derives from `DEFAULT_UPDATES_WINDOW_S` to prevent silent divergence.
- **Dead constant removed** — `BUCKET_THRESHOLDS_DEFAULT` dict was never used by the coordinator or config flow; removed.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed
- **Card install race**: replaced module-level `_CARD_INSTALLED` global with a `hass.data[DOMAIN]` flag, preventing duplicate Lovelace resource registration when multiple config entries set up concurrently
- **Speed filter false rejects**: increased minimum elapsed-time gate from `>0` to `>=5s` before computing implied speed; eliminates spurious `speed_filter` invalidations caused by GPS jitter on rapid successive state events
- **Coord-extraction log spam**: warning log now includes only the relevant location attributes (`latitude`, `longitude`, `location`, `gps_accuracy`) instead of the full state attribute dict, avoiding megabyte-sized log entries for entities with large attribute payloads (e.g. `media_player`)
- **State restore visibility**: persisted state restore failures now log with `exc_info=True`, so the underlying exception is visible instead of being silently swallowed
- **Lovelace `resources.loaded` mutation**: removed direct mutations of `ResourceStorageCollection.loaded`; Home Assistant manages this internally
- **Coordinator API hygiene**: renamed `_async_recalculate` → `async_recalculate` since it is invoked from `async_setup_entry`; the leading underscore was misleading

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- **Same Zone binary sensor** — `binary_sensor.*_same_zone` per pair: `ON` when both entities report the same named zone (e.g. both at `home`, both at `work`), `OFF` when they differ, `unavailable` when either entity is `not_home`, `unknown`, or `unavailable`
- **Zone-zone pair sensor reduction** — pairs where both entities are `zone.*` now create only Distance, Proximity Zone, and Proximity Zone Number sensors (motion-dependent sensors skipped: proximity, today-time, direction, speed, ETA, GPS accuracy, state, update count)

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- **Group Card: per-node label settings** — `node_settings` config key allows per-entity control of label visibility and position
  - `show_name`: show or hide the entity name label (default: `true`)
  - `show_state`: show or hide the entity state label (default: `true`, inherits global `show_state`)
  - `label_position`: `above`, `below`, or `auto` (default: `auto` — uses centroid-based detection)
  - All three settings are editable in the card editor under a new "Node Labels" section

### Fixed
- **Group Card**: connection line labels on horizontal edges (top row and bottom row) now always appear on the outward-facing side of the line — top-row labels go above, bottom-row labels go below
- **Group Card**: middle node (5-node layout) name/state label no longer flips between above and below on each hass state update — `_nodeLabelSide` cache now resets only on config change, not on every render
- **Group Card**: idle animation (slow node drift) now skips entirely when `fixed_layout: true` — nodes stay on their grid positions with no movement
- **Group Card**: node positions are now clamped to canvas bounds when an existing node is reused after a canvas resize
- **Group Card**: entity list change (add/remove entity) now correctly resets the settled flag and re-runs the force simulation
- **Group Card**: centroid epsilon guard prevents erratic line label flip when edge midpoint is very close to graph centroid
- **Group Card** (code quality): `_zoneColor` and `_dirArrow` use lookup objects instead of if-chains; `_watchIds` uses `flatMap`; `combinations()` hoisted out of loop; node label above/below duplication extracted to `_nodeLabel()` helper; editor pair settings extracted to `_renderPairSettings()`

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- **Group Card** (`entity-distance-group-card`) — force-directed SVG graph showing all group entities as circles with labeled connecting lines
  - Lines colored by proximity zone; thicker with glow effect when a pair is in proximity
  - Per-line labels: distance and/or zone text independently configurable per pair
  - Direction arrow on each line (↑ diverging, ↓ approaching, • stationary); hidden when both distance and zone labels are disabled
  - Grid-based initial node layout by entity count: 2 = vertical pair, 3 = triangle, 4 = 2×2, 5 = 3-row with center middle node
  - Adaptive label placement: entity name + state above circle for top-row nodes, below for bottom-row nodes
  - Background rectangles behind text labels to prevent line overlap
  - `fixed_layout` option: equal spacing regardless of real distance (default on)
  - Per-entity hide toggle in editor (eye icon) — hidden entities and all their connecting lines are removed from the graph
  - Badge: "X of N pairs in proximity" counting only visible pairs
  - `pair_settings` per-pair config keyed by sorted entity ID pair (`"entity_a,entity_b"`)
  - Tap a line to open the HA more-info panel for that pair's distance sensor
  - Editor: group selector dropdown, entity order list with ↑/↓ reorder and hide toggle, title field, equal spacing checkbox, per-pair distance/zone label toggles
  - Auto-discovers available groups from hass.states using clique detection — correctly separates multiple config entries
  - `ResizeObserver` ensures correct width in the HA sections layout
  - Idle animation: slow node drift for 6 s after last state update
  - `touch-action: manipulation` on SVG — no tap delay on mobile/Companion app

### Fixed
- Accuracy filter and speed filter no longer leave `data_valid = True` after rejecting a GPS reading — both now call `_invalidate()` so downstream sensors correctly reflect unavailable data
- Proximity duration sensor no longer returns `None` when `data_valid` is `False` but tracking has started — gates on `proximity_tracking_started` instead
- Config flow now rejects equal entry/exit threshold values (previously only rejected exit < entry, allowing a deadlock where entry could never be exited)
- Resync hold now marks `data_valid = False` while the hold is active — prevents stale data appearing valid during silence window
- Group card group discovery uses clique detection instead of BFS — multiple config entries sharing an entity no longer merge into one combined group
- `UpdateCountSensor` returned stale count after 30-min window expired — now returns `0` when window has elapsed
- Pair Card diagnostics showed full device-prefixed label ("Dercy & Italo GPS Accuracy") — labels now hardcoded, `friendly_name` parsing removed
- Pair Card and Avatar Card pair discovery used v0.1.0 `sensor.entity_distance_` prefix — now discovers pairs via `entity_a` attribute; entity ID lookups use `sensor.${slug}_` pattern
- Entity state badges overlapped the divider line below the hero row — added top padding to `.entity-states`
- Lovelace resource updater skipped non-`ResourceStorageCollection` setups — added fallback direct assignment
- Stale Lovelace resources from renamed cards (`entity-distance-card.js`, `entity-distance-people-card.js`) now auto-purged on startup
- Group card blank in `sections` layout — `ResizeObserver` now triggers layout after real card width is known
- `shouldUpdate` in Pair Card and Avatar Card accessed `old.states[id]` without optional chaining — could throw on first render
- `last_seen_together` now records when proximity **ends** (exit) rather than when it begins (entry) — Pair Card shows "Together now" while `in_proximity` is on
- Proximity duration sensor no longer resets to near-zero after HA restart — `proximity_since` is now persisted and restored
- Pair Card "Proximity duration since" timestamp now includes time-of-day, not just date
- Pair Card speed stat box label now reads "Diverging speed" when entities are moving apart
- `datetime.fromtimestamp` in resync hold replaced with `now + timedelta(seconds=...)` for timezone consistency
- `except Exception` in `button.py` now carries `# noqa: BLE001` suppression comment
- `validate.yml` CI workflow now has `permissions: contents: read` — resolves GitHub code scanning warnings

### Changed
- `TodayZoneTimeSensor` exposes `range_from_m` / `range_to_m` state attributes
- Proximity duration and proximity rate stat boxes now share one row when both are enabled
- Lovelace cards renamed: `entity-distance-card` → `entity-distance-pair-card`, `entity-distance-people-card` → `entity-distance-avatar-card`
- Group card badge shows "X of N pairs in proximity" instead of generic "In Proximity" label
- Card versions bumped to `0.2.0`; console log includes `— github.com/italo-lombardi` suffix

## [0.2.1b8] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed
- Group card group discovery uses clique detection instead of connected-components BFS — multiple config entries sharing an entity no longer merge into one combined group
- Group card `getStubConfig` no longer produces a merged entity list when multiple config entries exist

### Changed
- Group card `fixed_layout` defaults to `true` (equal spacing) for new cards
- Group card SVG gets `touch-action: manipulation` — eliminates 300 ms tap delay on mobile/Companion app
- `validate.yml` CI workflow gets `permissions: contents: read` — resolves GitHub code scanning warnings
- README screenshot paths corrected to `assets/screenshots/`
- `info.md` updated with Lovelace Cards section describing all three cards

## [0.2.1b7] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed
- Accuracy filter and speed filter no longer leave `data_valid = True` after rejecting a GPS reading — both now call `_invalidate()` so downstream sensors correctly reflect unavailable data
- Proximity duration sensor no longer returns `None` when `data_valid` is `False` but tracking has started — gates on `proximity_tracking_started` instead
- Config flow now rejects equal entry/exit threshold values (previously only rejected exit < entry, allowing a deadlock where entry could never be exited)
- Resync hold now marks `data_valid = False` while the hold is active — prevents stale data from appearing valid to sensors during the silence window

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-21

> **Breaking change:** v0.2.0 is not compatible with v0.1.0 config entries. Delete and recreate all Entity Distance integrations after upgrading.

### Added
- **Group tracking** — select 2–5 entities in a single config entry; all pairwise distances are tracked automatically (2 entities = 1 pair, 3 = 3 pairs, 4 = 6 pairs, 5 = 10 pairs)
- Group-level sensors for groups with 3+ entities: Min Distance (sensor), Any In Proximity (binary sensor), All In Proximity (binary sensor)
- Per-pair sub-devices linked to the group device in the HA device registry via `via_device`
- `CONF_ENTITIES` config key (list) replaces the old `entity_a` / `entity_b` pair
- `MINOR_VERSION = 1` added to satisfy HA 2024.3+ config flow requirements
- New config flow validation errors: `too_few_entities`, `too_many_entities` (> 5 entities), `duplicate_entities`
- Reverse entity-to-pairs index in coordinator for O(1) state change routing
- NaN/Infinity guard after `ha_distance()` call
- Domain priority ordering for entity pairs: `person > device_tracker > zone > sensor` — person always listed first in device and sensor names
- Pre-release detection in release workflow: tags matching `vX.Y.ZbN`, `vX.Y.ZaN`, `vX.Y.ZrcN` are automatically marked as GitHub pre-releases

### Changed
- Config flow Step 1 now uses a multi-select entity picker instead of two single-entity pickers
- Button now sends location refresh to all entities in the group (deduplicated)
- Pair device identifiers use entity IDs (not friendly names) — stable across entity renames
- `_calc_pair` is now a sync method (no awaits)
- `any_in_proximity` and `all_in_proximity` filter by `data_valid` before computing
- Group entity IDs fixed — `min_distance`, `any_in_proximity`, `all_in_proximity` no longer have duplicate device name suffix
- `PairData` legacy wrapper class removed
- `async_migrate_entry`, `CONF_ENTITY_A`, `CONF_ENTITY_B` removed — no migration path from v0.1.0

### Changed (deps)
- Bump `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` to `>=0.13.331` (HA core 2026.5.2)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- Track distance between any two people, devices, or zones
- Sensors: distance, proximity zone, direction, approach speed, estimated arrival time
- Proximity duration — total time spent together, live and accumulated
- Proximity Rate — percentage of tracked time spent together (since tracking started)
- Today proximity time and breakdown by zone (Very Near, Near, Medium, Far, Very Far)
- Last seen together timestamp
- Proximity Tracking Started — when tracking began for this pair (set once, never resets)
- Entity state sensors — mirrors the current Home Assistant state of each tracked person (Home, Away, zone name)
- Today Unaccounted Time — how many minutes today have no GPS data
- Binary sensor: In Proximity (with hysteresis to prevent flickering)
- Button: Refresh Location — requests an immediate GPS update from both devices
- 4 automation events: enter proximity, leave proximity, update, enter (unreliable)
- Configurable proximity thresholds — customize when each zone starts and ends
- Advanced filters — GPS accuracy limit, speed sanity check, reliability requirement
- Two Lovelace cards — data-focused card and people card with avatars
- Cards auto-register as Lovelace resources on load
- Pair history resets automatically if you reconfigure with different entities
- All sensors refresh every minute even when devices don't move
- State persists across HA restarts
- 11 language translations (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Polish, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish)

### Fixed
- Proximity duration no longer double-counts time across restarts
- Direction sensor correctly uses a 50 m stationary threshold to ignore GPS jitter
- Location refresh button works on both iOS and Android
- Sensors no longer go Unknown after reconfiguring the integration
- Update count correctly tracks per-entity, not shared between both people
