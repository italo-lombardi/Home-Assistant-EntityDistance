# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0-alpha.6] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **Proximity Tracking Started sensor** — timestamp of the first ever proximity entry; persisted across restarts; shown as "since [date]" in the card proximity duration box
- **Card stat boxes** — proximity duration, together today, last seen together, approach speed, and ETA now render as colored boxes (2-per-row grid, odd item spans full width)
- **Zone time chips** — "Time by zone today" breakdown replaced with horizontal colored pill chips
- **Distance value zone color** — hero distance value and zone label colored by proximity zone (green → grey gradient from Very Near to Very Far)
- **Card icons** — emoji icons on all stat labels (💨⏱⏳📅👁🗺🔬📡🕐🔄)
- **Card title redesign** — 📍 icon prefix; entity names bold, connector and suffixes non-bold
- **Diagnostics two-column layout** — GPS accuracy, last update, and update count grouped by person in left/right columns ordered by entity_a/entity_b

### Fixed
- **Update count incremented for both entities on every recalculate** — now only increments for the entity that actually triggered the state change via pending-update flags; 1-minute tick no longer inflates counts
- **Card suffix mismatches** — `_closing_speed` → `_approach_speed`, `_eta` → `_estimated_arrival_time`, `bucket` → `proximity_zone`, `_update_count_` prefix scan corrected
- **Diagnostics label showing full device name** — now strips device prefix and shows only sensor name (e.g. "GPS Accuracy" not "Entity Distance — Italo & Dercy GPS Accuracy (Italo)")
- **GPS accuracy showing raw float** — now rounded to 1 decimal place
- **Update count showing float** — now shown as integer
- **"Distance" in card title not stripped** — `_pairLabel` regex made optional dash so plain space before "Distance" is also stripped from sensor friendly name
- **Text selection blocked in cards** — added `user-select: text` to `:host` styles in both cards
- **0 duration showing "< 1 min"** — now shows "0 min"

## [0.1.0-alpha.5] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **Entity State sensors** — two new sensors (`State (Name A)`, `State (Name B)`) mirroring the HA state of each tracked entity (home, away, zone name, etc.); read-only, no manipulation
- **Today Unaccounted Time sensor** — tracks minutes since last successful distance calculation, capped at midnight; shows how much of today has no data (e.g. due to HA restart or GPS silence)
- **State persistence** — today proximity time, today zone times, proximity duration, and last seen together survive HA restarts and integration reloads; stored via HA `Store`; today counters only restored if the stored date matches today
- **Live sensor updates** — all sensors now refresh every minute via a 1-minute timer tick, even when tracked entities don't move; proximity duration and unaccounted time stay accurate between GPS updates
- **Update Count icon** — `mdi:update` icon added to Update Count sensors

### Fixed
- **Lovelace cards broken** — both cards used wrong entity ID suffixes (`bucket` instead of `proximity_zone`, `today_zone_time_*` instead of `today_*_time`, `gps_accuracy_a/b` instead of dynamic name-based IDs, binary sensor `_proximity` instead of `_in_proximity`); all fixed by scanning `hass.states` for dynamic per-entity suffixes and correcting static suffix mappings
- **Card pair slug derivation** — slug was derived from binary sensor entity ID (which HA appends `_in` to due to "In Proximity" name), causing all sensor lookups to fail; now derived from `sensor.entity_distance_*_distance` entity IDs
- **Logo background color** — logo SVG still used old dark navy background (`#1a1a2e`) instead of medium blue-slate (`#405d95`) introduced in alpha.4; pin hole colors also corrected

### Changed
- **People card editor** — Person A / Person B fields changed from free-text input to dropdown listing all `person.*` and `device_tracker.*` entities with friendly names

## [0.1.0-alpha.4] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **Icons** — `icons.json` with MDI icons for all sensors, binary sensor (open/closed states), and button

### Changed
- **Today Zone Time sensors** — removed `DIAGNOSTIC` category; now shown as regular sensors alongside Today Proximity Time
- **Update Count sensors** — renamed to `Update Count Last 30 min (A/B)` to make the 30-minute window explicit; updated in all 11 language files
- **Integration icon** — lightened background from dark navy to medium blue-slate (`#405d95`)

## [0.1.0-alpha.3] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **Today zone time sensors** — 5 new sensors tracking minutes spent in each proximity zone today (Very Near, Near, Medium, Far, Very Far); reset at midnight
- **Direction Level sensor** — numeric companion to Direction: -1 = approaching, 0 = stationary, 1 = diverging; enables automation comparisons without string matching
- **Entity Distance People Card** (`entity-distance-people-card`) — new Lovelace card with entity avatars side-by-side; shows entity pictures if available, falls back to initials; same slug-based config as Card A
- Both Lovelace cards now auto-registered as Lovelace resources on integration load

### Changed
- **Update Count replaces Update Frequency** — `Update Frequency (A/B)` sensors replaced by `Update Count (A/B)`: raw integer count of location updates in the last 30 minutes (window extended from 5 → 30 min for meaningful signal across all GPS modes)
- **Stationary threshold raised** — movement < 50 m between updates classified as stationary (was 5 m); prevents GPS jitter from falsely showing approaching/diverging
- **Default GPS error radius raised** — 100 m → 150 m (covers Android indoors which commonly reports 100 m accuracy)
- **Entity Distance Card rewritten** — now uses LitElement via `customElements.whenDefined` (same pattern as EntityAvailability card); pair selection via slug dropdown auto-populated from live hass states; full options editor with sections for Main Display, Movement, Time Together, Diagnostics, Layout
- Resync silence threshold uses `>=` instead of `>` (off-by-one fix)

### Removed
- **Data Staleness sensors** — removed `Location Age (A/B)` sensors; `Last Update (A/B)` timestamp sensors serve the same purpose more accurately (staleness was a frozen snapshot, not live)

## [0.1.0-alpha.2] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **Proximity Zone Number sensor** — numeric equivalent of Proximity Zone (1 = Very Near … 5 = Very Far); use in automations without string comparisons
- **Configurable zone thresholds** — new optional "Zone Thresholds" step in config/options flow to customize Very Near / Near / Medium / Far distances; defaults updated to 100 / 500 / 2000 / 10000 m
- Validation: zone thresholds must be strictly ascending (Very Near < Near < Medium < Far)

### Fixed
- Refresh Location button now sends `request_location_update` via `notify.mobile_app_*` (works on iOS and Android); previously called a non-existent service and always failed
- Sensors no longer go Unknown after reconfiguring — coordinator immediately recalculates from current state on reload instead of waiting for next GPS event
- Internal `_show_advanced` temp key no longer leaks into config entry data
- `mock_config_entry` test fixture now sets `entry.options = {}` to match coordinator's merged data read

### Changed
- Default GPS error radius: 100 m → 150 m (covers Android indoors which commonly reports 100 m accuracy)
- Proximity Zone "Mid" renamed to "Medium" in UI (internal key `mid` unchanged)
- Proximity zone defaults: Very Near 50 m → 100 m, Near 200 m → 500 m, Mid 1 km → 2 km, Far 5 km → 10 km
- Coordinator reads from merged `entry.data + entry.options` (was `entry.data` only)
- Sensor renames: "Closing Speed" → "Approach Speed", "ETA" → "Estimated Arrival Time", "Data Staleness" → "Location Age"
- UI label improvements: "Nearby distance" → "Nearby threshold", "Away distance" → "Away threshold", "Update delay" → "Location update delay", "Max GPS inaccuracy" → "Max GPS error radius", "Max speed filter" → "Max plausible speed", "Updates needed to be reliable" → "Consecutive updates required for reliability"
- Error messages made more precise and consistent with field labels
- Config flow step 1 title changed from "Entity Pair" to "Choose Entities"
